# Intro | Programing using C++

On January 19, 2022 I created my first C++ program for an in class assignment. The user will be Prompt to enter an Interger, a char, and their First name. 
Then the user will be greeted with a message showing what they were prompted.

## Key Concepts
1. cout << (Is used to show the user a message from the program, for example a command or question.)
2. cin >>  (Is used for a user to input what the program is asking for.)
3. int main() {
               }
4. endl     (Is used to end the line, any thing that comes after will begin on a new line or cell.)
5. ;       (Is required at the end of every line.
