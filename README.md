# Intro | Programing using C++

On January 19, 2022 I created my first C++ program for a class assignment. The user will be Prompt to enter an Interger, a char, and their First name. 
Then the user will be greeted with a message showing what they were prompted.

## Key Concepts
1. cout << (Is used to show the user an output from the program, for example a question.)
2. cin >>  (Is used for a user to input what the program is asking for.)
3. int main() {
               }
